Hi All.  I have put all your names on my Anti-Cannabis legalization group.  Please let me know if I have 
put you in the wrong group.  I think the best way to communicate is just reply all to this email, but let 
me know if that becomes unwieldy and I can see about putting together a group in Canvas.  The link to a 
broad selection of articles is here:
https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/41939/pages/session-9

But you are certainly free to use the Google to look for more. If you find something interesting, please 
send it to me and I will post it on the Session 9 page.
We'll have another breakout session next week.
Best
Ollie
