Hi All.  I have put all your names on my Anti-Cannabis legalization  
group.  Please let me know if I have put you in the wrong group.  I  
think the best way to communicate is just reply all to this email, but  
let me know if that becomes unwieldy and I can see about putting  
together a group in Canvas.  The link to a broad selection of articles  
is here: 
https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/41939/pages/session-9 
 
But you are certainly free to use the Google to look for more. If you  
find something interesting, please send it to me and I will post it on  
the Session 9 page. 
We'll have another breakout session next week. 
Best 
Ollie
