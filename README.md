# HILR Course: The War on Drugs, fall 2018.

This repository contains the course materials and my notes from the HILR course "The War on Drugs" given in fall 2018 by Ollie Curme.  I tried to capture all the wonderful, comprehensive reading materials that Ollie prepared for the course, and I have added my own notes from the reading and the class discussions.  

My notes are in XMind format, prepared using XMind versions 6, 7.5, and 8.  I used the free version, I admit, of this spectacularly effective tool, because I am retired and cheap.
