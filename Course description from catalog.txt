323 The War on Drugs
Ollie Curme
Readings: The SGL will prepare a written presentation each week
that summarizes information in current books and other literature.
Links to additional scholarly journal articles, news items, YouTube
videos, and other sources will be posted on the course website.
In 1969, 1,601 Americans died from drug overdoses. In
1971, President Nixon announced his war on drugs. In 2016,
64,070 Americans died from drug overdoses. How could our
public policy have been so ineffectual or counterproductive?
We will examine the history of drug use and prosecution in
the United States, from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics in
the 1930s to Nixon’s war on drugs, the dramatic increase in
incarceration, the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1990s, and
the opioid crisis of this century. Throughout the course, we
will focus on the tension between the social, racial, political,
and economic forces within society that support the drug
trade versus those arrayed against it. We will finish with a
debate about alternative solutions to the problem. The class
will be half SGL presentation and videos and half discussion.
All members must be able to access the class website to
obtain the posted readings. At least two hours of preparation
per week. Class size limited to 25.
Ollie Curme is interested in seemingly intractable social problems
and social justice.
