A few excerpts from the introduction to Naked Lunch by William Burroughs.  The book is a recollection of his fifteen years as an opiate addict, a combination of contemporary ramblings and notes from the perspective of recovery.  How many addicts survive fifteen years and come clean and then write about it?  It was published in 1959, almost sixty years ago; I don't think it is any less relevant today.  


The Sickness is drug addiction and I was an addict for fifteen years.  When I say addict I mean an addict to junk (generic term for opium and/or derivatives including all synthetics from demerol to palfium).  I have used junk in many forms: morphine, heroin, dilaudid, eukodal, pantopon, diocodid, diosane, opium, demerol, dolophine, palfium.  I have smoked junk, eaten it, sniffed it, injected it in vein-skin-muscle, inserted it in rectal suppositories.  The needle is not important.  Whether you sniff it smoke it eat it or shove is up your ass the result is the same: addiction.  

 . . . 

Junk is the ideal product . . . the ultimate merchandise.  No sales talk necessary.  The client will crawl through a sewer and beg to buy. . . .  

 . . . 

If we wish to annihilate the junk pyramid, we must start at the bottom of the pyramid: the Addict in the Street, and stop tilting quixotically for the "higher ups" so called, all of whom are immediately replaceable.  The addict in the street who must have junk to live is the one irreplaceable factor in the junk equation.  When there are no more addicts to buy junk there will be no junk traffic.  As long as junk need exists, someone will service it.  

 . . . 

The junk virus is the public health problem number one of the world today.
